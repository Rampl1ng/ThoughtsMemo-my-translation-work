# Displeasure of learning

学习的不快

When I claim that all learning is pleasurable, I hear a chorus of voices like "*I had to go through an awfully stressful exam that gave me lots of good knowledge for life*". Those voices confuse the pleasure of good learning with the displeasure of factors that turn learning into a horror for many students. Those horror factors are bad teachers, harsh parents, deadlines, stress, bad sleep, awful textbooks, excess volume, and more.

当我声称「所有的学习都是快乐的」时候，我听到了各种的声音，比如「**我必须通过一场压力极大的考试，因为它会带给我很多终身受用的知识**」。这些声音把「良好学习的乐趣」与「使学习成为恐惧的不快因素」混为一谈。这些可怕的因素可能涉及糟糕的老师、苛刻的家长、截止日期、压力、低质量的睡眠、烂教材、过多的学习量等等。

I hear that without deadlines or school-imposed goals, the learning would be replaced with videogames, novels, TV, hobbies, sports, etc. This might be true for many reasons. Some of those activities may carry pleasures unrelated to learning. However, they will also be beneficial for reasons of learning or exercise. A well-rounded student should be free to slow down, allocate his time for fun learning and other fun activities. Slow progress might bring more benefit.

我听说，如果没有最后期限或学校强加的目标，学习将被电子游戏、小说、电视、业余爱好、运动等所取代。出于许多原因，这可能是对的。这些活动中的某些可能会给人带来学习之外的乐趣。然而，它们也有学习或锻炼方面的益处。一个全面发展的学生会自由地放慢学习进度，把时间分配给有趣的学习或是其他有趣的活动。「慢慢来」可能会带来更多的益处。

There is no way the equation of learning could produce unhappiness in the wake of good learning. The blame will always be elsewhere. All negatives should be studied and eliminated.

在学习的等式中，良好的学习不可能会产生不快乐。真正的罪魁祸首永远在别处。所有的负面因素都应该加以研究，并消除。

In the ultimate account, even if there is a displeasure related to exams, certificates and duties, this displeasure should be imposed on the student by herself.

归根结底，即便与考试、证书、职责相关的不愉快必须存在，这种不愉快也应该由学生自愿强加给自己。

**Pleasurable learning can be buried in displeasure caused by stress, bad people, bad schools, bad textbooks, and more**.

**愉快的学习可能会被淹没在压力、坏人、学校、烂教材等共同造成的不愉快中**。
