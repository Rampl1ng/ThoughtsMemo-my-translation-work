# Myth: You can improve education by throwing more money in it

谬误：你可以投入更多的钱来提升教育水平

This text is part of: "*[I would never send my kids to school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling)*" by [Piotr Wozniak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak) (2017)

Lots of people believe in the myth that we can improve the school system by throwing a lot of money in it. This myth is based on, and as pervasive as, the myth that we need teaching to achieve learning (see: [Do we need teachers?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Do_we_need_teachers`%3`F)). The smartest brains have fallen for the myth at a high cost (see: [Bill Gates is wrong about education](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_is_wrong_about_education)). In reality, [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning) based on child's own choices is the most efficient way of learning, and it costs virtually nothing. The world around is rich in learning opportunities. All it takes is to get an individual engaged into accomplishing any goal based on a [child's passion](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Child's_passion). We can safely trust the algorithms of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) for the kid to make highly efficient educational choices. Today, even a cheap laptop may work better than a school (see: [Hole in the wall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Hole_in_the_wall)).

很多人相信这样一个谬误，即我们可以通过投入大量资金来改善学校系统。这个谬误就像我们需要人教才能实现学习一样普遍且荒谬（见：[我们需要老师吗？](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Do_we_need_teachers%3F)）。即使是最聪明的大脑也可能会以高昂的代价陷入谬误（见：[比尔·盖茨对教育的看法错了](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_is_wrong_about_education)）。实际上，基于自主选择的[自由学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning)才是最有效的学习途径，并且它几乎没有成本。全世界都充满了各种学习机会。所需要的只是根据[孩子的激情](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Child's_passion)参与实现任何目标。我们可以放心地相信[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)算法，它会让孩子做出高效的教育选择。如今，一台便宜的笔记本电脑也可能比学校更好用（见：[凿壁上网](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Hole_in_the_wall)）。

The climbing school for horses is a good metaphor on how we waste money on education:

马匹攀爬学校形象地比喻了我们是如何在教育上浪费金钱的：

Imagine a school for horses that would teach them to climb trees. A low cost school would have a poorly paid teacher shout at the horse: *"Climb!"*. The yelling would go all day long and bring nothing good. If a horse rested its hooved on the tree, we would celebrate maximum success. A well financed school might provide assisting lifts for horses, safety devices, experts in horse psychology, Skinner boxes for teaching tree climbing theory, apple slices and carrots of rich reward for learning progress, etc. Only a billion dollars could finally make it work: design and production of horse climbing exoskeletons. Only horses would still cry for their lost pastures

想象一所会教马匹爬树的学校。在一所低成本的学校里，会有一个薪水很低的老师对着马喊：“**爬上去！**”那叫喊会持续一整天，并且不会带来任何好处。当马儿停在树上歇蹄子了，我们便会把这次行动视作成功，并为其庆祝。一所资金充足的学校可能会为马匹提供辅助升降机、安全装置、马心理学专家、教授爬树理论的斯金纳箱、用于奖励学习进步的苹果片和胡萝卜等等。最终要花费十亿美元才能使其发挥作用：设计和生产用于马爬树的外骨骼。而马还在为失去的牧场哭泣。

The above metaphor shows the absurdity of the investment because we know that horses will never climb trees. Schools on the other hand, have their own ways of masking or mitigating absurdity:

上面的比喻显示了投资的荒谬，因为我们知道马永远不会爬树。另一方面，学校有自己的方法来掩盖或减轻这一荒谬：

\- some learning takes place, and even if it is 1% of what is possible, schools will use this as a proof of their efficiency (see: [13 years of school in one month](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/13_years_of_school_in_one_month))

\- 确实在学校也学到了东西，即使它只占据可能的 1%，学校也会以此作为其效率的证明（见：[一个月完成 13 年学业]( https://supermemo.guru/wiki/13_years_of_school_in_one_month)）

\- [old soup problem](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Old_soup_problem) makes a bit of good learning hide a great deal of bad learning

\- [老汤问题](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Old_soup_problem)使一些好的学习掩盖了大量坏的学习。

\- schools take credit for what students accomplish on their own, e.g. while learning at home

\- 学校将学生的功劳据为己有，例如在家学习的时候

\- graduates quickly forget the pains and give school the credit for their own achievement (see: [Glorification of schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Glorification_of_schooling))

\- 毕业生很快就会忘记痛苦，并将自己的成就归功于学校（见：[对学校教育的美化](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Glorification_of_schooling)）

An interesting argument is that we might pay schools more to hire sports stars as PE coaches and transform how we teach sports. Sports are more than just [declarative learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Declarative_learning), however, we can instantly see that we will hit the wall of star scarcity, star pay, and the problem of star skills in the area of pedagogy. Doubling the investment in education is unlikely, and star coaches would call for much more than just doubling. An efficient solution is to have best coaches attract voluntary participation from youth. Parents could spend their money on efficient coaching instead of inefficient school bureaucracy that would hardly make a good use of a good coach. If that solution is not egalitarian enough, parents could use [school vouchers](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_voucher) and still be guided by a child's passion. Last but not least, there are plenty of great coaches in public schools. They lack no skills. It is the malaise that affects today's youth that is the key problem. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. The system needs a redesign (see: [Grand School Reform](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Grand_School_Reform)).

一个有趣的论点是，我们可能会向学校支付更多费用，以聘请体育明星担任体育课教练，并改变我们教授体育的方式。体育不仅仅是[陈述式学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Declarative_learning)，然而，我们会立刻在明星稀缺、明星薪酬和明星在教学方法的缺失等问题上碰壁。投资翻倍是不不现实的，并且明星教练要求的也不仅仅是翻倍。一个有效培养优秀体育老师的办法是吸引年轻的教练自愿参与。家长的钱应该被花在有效的体育教学上，而不是花在无效的学校官僚主义上。学校官僚主义很难充分利用好一个教练。如果该解决方案仍然不够公平，那么父母可以采用[学券制](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_voucher)，以孩子的热情为导向。最后，公立学校有很多优秀的教练，他们并不缺技能。引起当今青年的不适才是问题的关键所在。把马牵到水边很容易，但强迫它喝水很难。该系统需要重构（见：[伟大的学校改革](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Grand_School_Reform)）。

Similar reasoning is used to suggest that schools might hire better psychologists and education experts. Those would allegedly improve learning and socialization. However, for the same reason for which a psychologists won't make a horse climb a tree, new hires would not remedy the inherent problems of [passive schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passive_schooling) or [closed systems of socialization](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Closed_systems_of_socialization). Even if the goals were achievable, all efforts thus far prove that the costs are exorbitant, and benefits negligible.

类似的推理可被用于聘请心理学家和教育专家上。据称，这些将改善学习和社交。然而，出于心理学家不会让马爬树的原因，新员工无法解决[被动学校教育](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passive_schooling)或[封闭系统社会化](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Closed_systems_of_socialization)的固有问题。即使这些目标是可以实现的，但迄今为止的所有努力都证明成本过高，收益微不足道。

If we look at less developed countries, we can indeed see the value of investment in schools. However, the benefits hit the wall at some point. More investment in schools of old design will drive them in the direction of similar schools in the west, which ultimately hurt children by undermining their self-esteem, killing the love of learning, generating [learned helplessness](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness), etc. In the LDCs, investment in education shows diminishing returns. This is discussed in: [We need more bad schools](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/We_need_more_bad_schools).

如果我们把目光望向欠发达国家，我们确实可以看到对学校进行投资所产生的价值。然而，这些好处有时也会遇见瓶颈。对旧设计的学校进行更多的投资将推动它向类似的西方学校的方向发展，这最终会损害他们的自尊心、扼杀他们对学习的热爱、产生[习得性无助](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness)等。在欠发达国家，教育投资的收益呈现递减的趋势。我们在[「我们需要更多烂学校」](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/We_need_more_bad_schools)中讨论过。

Education policy expert, [Justin Sandefur](https://www.cgdev.org/expert/justin-sandefur) of Center for Global Development put it best ([source](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/world-needs-more-bad-schools)):

教育政策专家，全球发展中心的[Justin Sandefur](https://www.cgdev.org/expert/justin-sandefur)说得好（[来源](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/world-needs-more-bad-schools)）：

\> A vast body of research questions the link between education spending and learning outcomes, and some of the best micro research on interventions to improve learning focuses on things that cost zero money, or even reduce education budgets

\> 大量研究质疑教育支出与学习成果之间的联系。还有一些最佳微观研究提出了有关改善学习侧重点的干预措施，比如侧重于零成本，甚至减少教育预算。

Learning and socialization are easy and cheap if they are based on a child's freedom of choice.

学习和适应社会是简单且廉价的，前提是基于孩子的选择自由。

Investments in education are throwing good money after bad

教育投资会在失败后转向正确。
