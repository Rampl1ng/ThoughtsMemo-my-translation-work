A new study on the mental health effects of kindergarten enrollment ages found strong evidence that a one-year delay dramatically improves a child’s self-regulation abilities even into later childhood.

一项关于幼儿园入学年龄对心理健康影响的新研究证明推迟一年会极大地提高儿童的自我调节能力，甚至会影响到童年。

According to the study co-authored by Stanford [Graduate School of Education](https://ed.stanford.edu/news/ed.stanford.edu) Professor [Thomas Dee](http://cepa.stanford.edu/thomas-dee), children who started kindergarten a year later showed significantly lower levels of inattention and hyperactivity, which are jointly considered a key indicator of self regulation. The beneficial result was found to persist even at age 11.

根据斯坦福大学[教育研究生院](https://ed.stanford.edu/news/ed.stanford.edu)教授 [Thomas Dee](http://cepa.stanford.edu/thomas-dee) 共同撰写的研究报告所指出，晚一年上幼儿园的儿童表现出明显较低水平的注意力不集中和多动性。这两者通常被认为是自我调节的关键指标。这一有益的现象甚至会延续到 11 岁。

“We found that delaying kindergarten for one year reduced inattention and hyperactivity by 73 percent for an average child at age 11,” Dee said, “and it virtually eliminated the probability that an average child at that age would have an ‘abnormal,’ or higher-than-normal rating for the inattentive-hyperactive behavioral measure.”

“我们发现，对于 11 岁的普通儿童来说，因为推迟了一年上幼儿园，注意力不集中和多动的水平明显降低了 73%，并且**几乎完全消除了**在该年龄段的普通儿童在「注意力不集中-多动行为测量」方面出现「异常」或「超出正常水平」的可能性。”

Findings from the study, which Dee co-authored with Hans Henrik Sievertsen of the Danish National Centre for Social Research, could help parents in the recurring debate over the pros and cons of a later school entry.

Dee 和丹麦国家社会研究中心的 Hans Henrik Sievertsen 共同撰写的这项研究成果，可以对父母反复权衡延迟入学的利弊。

Though many children in developed countries now start their formal schooling at an older age, a growing body of empirical studies could neither conclusively point to improved test scores nor higher incomes from a delayed kindergarten entry, the study stated.

尽管在许多发达国家儿童开始接受正规学校教育的年龄越来越大，但大量的实践研究表明此举无法断定延迟入学会提高考试成绩，也不能帮助增加收入。该研究指出。

Dee and Sievertsen’s research, however, provides new evidence instead on mental health aspects that are predictors of educational outcomes.

然而，Dee 和 Sievertsen 的研究反而为预测教育成果的心理健康方面提供了新证据。

In the psychology realm, the measure of inattention and hyperactivity – the mental health traits behind Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder – effectively reflects the concept of self regulation. A higher level of self regulation, which describes a person’s ability to control impulses and modulate behavior in attaining goals, is commonly linked to student achievement.

在心理学领域，对注意力不集中和多动性的衡量——多动症（ADHD）背后的心理健康特征——有效地反映了自我调节的概念。较高的自我调节水平，即描述一个人在实现目标时控制冲动和调节行为的能力，通常与学生的成绩关联。

**Staying focused, faring better**

**保持专注，更上一层楼**。

The underlying theory is that youngsters and teens who can stay focused, sit still and pay attention longer, fare better in school.

其基本理论是，能够保持专注、静坐、注意力持久的青少年，在学校的表现更好。

Dee’s study found similar correlations: comparisons of seven-year-old children attending the same schools showed that the students who had lower inattention-hyperactivity ratings had higher school assessment scores.

Dee 的研究也有类似的相关性：通过对就读于同一所学校的 7 岁儿童进行比较显示，自我调节评分较低的学生在学校往往可以取得较高的评估分数。

For the study, researchers used data from a nationwide mental-health screening tool of children in Denmark – a survey that is widely used internationally in clinical and academic settings – and matched it against the Danish census. Linking the two allowed researchers to make analyses using exact dates of birth, allowing for robust comparisons among similarly aged children.

在这项研究中，研究人员使用了来自丹麦全国范围内的儿童心理健康筛查工具的数据——这项调查在国际上被广泛用于临床和学术场合——并与丹麦人口普查相匹配。将两者结合起来，能够让研究人员使用准确的出生日期进行分析，从而在年龄相近的儿童之间进行有力的比较。

Because children in Denmark enroll in kindergarten in the calendar year they turn six, kids born exactly on Dec. 31 would have started kindergarten earlier that year, while those born a day later on Jan. 1 would be 6-years-and-8-months old when they start formal schooling. 

因为丹麦的儿童在他们年满 6 周岁才进入幼儿园，所以正好出生在 12 月 31 日的孩子会在该年早些时候开始上幼儿园，而那些在 1 月 1 日出生的孩子在开始正式学校教育时将是 6 岁 8 个月大。

Researchers were thus able to examine differences between children who were born a certain number of days before the Dec. 31 enrollment cut-off and those born after the cut-off. They used full-sample sizes from the parent-reported mental health survey; 54,241 parents responded when their children were age 7 and 35,902 responded when the children were about 11 years old.

因此，研究人员能够检查在 12 月 31 日入学截止日期前一定天数出生的儿童和截止日期后出身的儿童之间的差异。他们使用了父母报告的心理健康调查的全样本规模。其中 54241 名家长在孩子 7 岁时作出了回应，35902 名家长在孩子 11 岁时作出了回应。

Large effects of significantly improved mental health were consistently found in the inattention-hyperactivity category, for both boys and girls, according to the study.

根据该研究，在注意力不集中及多动症类别中，不断地发现改善孩子心理健康所产生的影响。这一影响在男孩和女孩身上都有体现。

“This is some of the most convincing evidence we’ve seen to support what parents and policymakers have already been doing – choosing to delay kindergarten entry,” Dee said.

“这是我们看见的最有说服力的证据，用来支持父母和决策者已经在做的事情，即推迟进入幼儿园。” Dee 说。

The percentage of children entering kindergarten at age six instead of age five has steadily increased to about 20 percent in the United States, according to the study. Part of the trend stems from school policy changes, but most of the increase can be attributed to academic “redshirting” – a sports term for the practice of postponing a college athlete’s participation in competitive games.

根据这项研究，在美国，选择 6 岁进入幼儿园而不是 5 岁的比例已经稳步上升到约 20%。部分趋势源于学校政策的改变，但大部分的增长可以归因于学业上的「暂时退出」。

Many parents are opting to delay kindergarten enrollment for a year in the hope of giving their children a leg up in maturity and other social emotional skills.

许多家长选择推迟一年进入幼儿园，是希望给他们的孩子在成熟和其他社会情感技能上更多的帮助。

“The study will give comfort to those who have done it,” Dee said. “And for those who are making the decision, it’ll give them a chance to consider the benefits.”

“这项研究给那些已经做过的家长以安慰”，Dee 说。“对于那些正在考虑的家长，它提供了一个机会来考虑好处。”

Dee noted, however, that decisions about schooling involve several factors and this study addresses one area. He suggests conversations about start time include both teachers and parents.  

然而，Dee 指出，关于学校教育的决定涉及多个因素，这项研究涉及一个领域。他建议关于开学时间的谈话要把老师和家长都包括进去。

Dee also said while there are strong, large effects in the study, kids who delay kindergarten in Denmark have universal access to reasonably good pre-K. In the absence of consistent access to good pre-K, Dee said, children in the U.S. may not be as harmed by starting kindergarten earlier.

Dee 还说，虽然研究存在着强烈巨大的影响，但在丹麦，推迟上幼儿园的孩子也能普遍获得相当好的学前教育。Dee 说，在缺少持续的、良好的学前教育的情况下，影响可能不会扩散的美国儿童上，因为他们会受到来自「提前上幼儿园」的伤害。

**Prolonging play**

延迟玩耍

The study’s findings also align with other research that has shown an extended period of early childhood play – such as in preschools – yields mental health developmental gains.

该研究的成果也与其他研究相一致，这些研究表明，长期进行儿童早期玩耍——比如学前班——心理健康会得到发展。

As a result, Dee said he hopes his research will lead to broader examinations on how kindergarten is taught. It could be pedagogy pointed more toward play rather than structured academics.

因此，Dee 说他希望他的研究能促使对幼儿园教学方式进一步的审查。让教学方式更多地指向「玩」，而不是结构化的学术。

“It’s not just a question of when do you start kindergarten, but what do you do in those kindergarten classes?” Dee said. “If you make kindergarten the new first grade, then parents may sensibly decide to delay entry. If kindergarten is not the new first grade, then parents may not delay children’s entries as much.”

“这不仅仅是一个何时开始上幼儿园的问题，而是你能在幼儿园班级里做什么？” Dee 说。“如果你把幼儿园当作新的「一年级」，那么家长会很明智地决定推迟入学。如果幼儿园不是新的「一年级」，那么家长绝不会选择推迟。”

The study, aptly titled,[ “The Gift of Time? School Starting Age and Mental Health,”](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21610) was published Oct. 5, by the National Bureau of Economic Research. A version of the article is also available [here](http://cepa.stanford.edu/content/gift-time-school-starting-age-and-mental-health) as a working paper from the [Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis](http://cepa.stanford.edu/) at the GSE. The research was supported in part with a grant from The Danish Council for Strategic Research.

这项研究的题目取的很贴切，[《时间的礼物？入学年龄与心理健康》](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21610)于 10 月 5 日发表在国家经济研究局。该文章叶可从 GSE 的[斯坦福教育政策分析中心](http://cepa.stanford.edu/content/gift-time-school-starting-age-and-mental-health)获取，作为一份工作文件。这项研究得到丹麦战略研究委员会的部分支持。
