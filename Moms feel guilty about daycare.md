Working moms often feel guilty about sending kids to daycare. They instinctively know they are hurting the kid. This is why when science brings any good news about the impact of daycare, moms around the world celebrate. This contributes to a new culture in which daycare is gradually shifted from the status of **necessary evil** to the status of a **good thing**.

职场妈妈们常常会因为把孩子送到托儿所而感到愧疚。她们本能地知道这是在伤害自己的孩子。这也是为什么每当传出有关托儿所的积极影响的消息时，全世界的母亲都会为此高兴。这也有助于形成一种新的文化，即托儿所的地位从「必要之恶」转变为「一件好事」。

\> Moms I know will tell you they often feel guilty about the same damn thing: What they give to their careers, they might be taking away from their children. [...] Research tells us that our **working mom status may actually be helpful to our children** in the long run [...] High quality child care appears to provide a small boost to academic performance [...] Kids who are regularly exposed to large groups of children before the age of 2 1/2, get sick significantly less in their elementary school years [...] I guess all those sick days weren’t wasted! [...] girls who grew up with a working mother actually surpassed the career achievements of those who did not [...] I hope these stats do something to put the minds of working moms at ease

我知道的妈妈们，她们都会告诉你，她们经常为同一件事感到愧疚，即她们为事业所付出的，可能会从孩子身上夺走。 [...] 研究结果告诉我们，从长远来看，**职场妈妈的身份可能真的有可能对我们的孩子有帮助。**[...] 高质量的儿童护理似乎能促使学习成绩小幅提升。[...] 如果孩子在两岁半以前有接触过大群儿童，那么他们在小学阶段生病的次数会明显减少。[...] 我想所有的这些病假都没有白费！[...] 如果女孩成长过程中没有妈妈的陪伴，因为她们长期忙于工作，这些女孩的职业成就会远超出那些母亲是家庭主妇的女孩。[...] 我希望这些统计数字能够让在职妈妈们安心。

The above good-hearted article sounds happy, however, it perpetuates dangerous myths. We should remember that:

上面这篇文章听起来让人很开心，然而，它延续了危险的谬误。我们应该记住：

\- measures of academic performance are far better in capturing conformity than capturing brain power

\- 衡量学习成绩的标准远比衡量脑力的标准更能反映出一致性

\- infections contracted in daycare are very dangerous (see [Daycare infections](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_infections))

\- 在托儿所感染是非常危险的。（见[托儿所感染](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_infections)）

\- cross-generational correlations come from both nature and nurture, and we should celebrate as they seem to be showing lots of progress

\- 跨代的关联性来自于天性和养育，我们应该庆祝，因为他们好像取得了不错的进展

Science has very little comfort against the stark reality: sending kids to daycare is harmful. See: [Harm of daycare](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery)

科学对严酷的现实没有任何安慰：把孩子送到托儿所是有害的。见：[幼儿园的危害](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery)
