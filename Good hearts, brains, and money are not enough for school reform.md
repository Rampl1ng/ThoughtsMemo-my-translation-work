# Good hearts, brains, and money are not enough for school reform

好心、聪明和金钱并不足以推动学校改革

[Good hearts, brains, and money are not enough for school reform - supermemo.guru](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_hearts,_brains,_and_money_are_not_enough_for_school_reform)

Poverty and the culture of poverty are the root cause of bad outcomes in education. Over and over again, "reformers" come to believe that improving schools can change the situation. Over and over again, they get burnt. In the process, schooling becomes an accelerating race to fewer and fewer freedoms for the young generation. See: [Problem of schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_schooling).

贫困和贫穷文化是导致教育质量不佳的根本原因。一次又一次，“改革家们”相信改善学校可以改变这种情况，但却一次又一次地碰壁。在这个过程中，教育变成了一场加速剥夺年轻一代自由的竞赛。更多详情请见：[学校问题](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_schooling)。

A book by [Dale Russakoff](http://dalerussakoff.com/) describes an effort by Mark Zuckerberg, [Cory Booker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker), and Chris Christie to reform Newark (NJ) schools. Zuckerberg offered $100 million and the plan was to see major reforms that would take root in just 5 years.

[Dale Russakoff](http://dalerussakoff.com/) 的一本书描述了马克·扎克伯格、[Cory Booker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker) 和 Chris Christie 试图改革新泽西州纽瓦克市的公立学校。扎克伯格提供了 1 亿美元，计划在短短 5 年内实现重大改革。

According to Russakoff:

根据 Russakoff 所说：

\> “Their stated goal was not to repair education in Newark but to develop a model for saving it in all of urban America.”

他们宣称此举不是为了修复纽瓦克的教育，而是开发一种能够拯救所有城市美国教育的模式。

Alex Kotlowitz in his book review writes:

Alex Kotlowitz 在他的书评中写道：

\> From the get-go, there seemed little agreement as to how best to proceed. More than anything, Christie wanted to break the hold of the entrenched teachers’ unions. Booker wanted more charter schools. Zuckerberg wanted to raise the status of teachers and to reward teaching that improved students’ performance

一开始，似乎没有人对如何最好地继续下去达成共识。最重要的是，Christie 想要打破根深蒂固的教师工会的控制。Booker 想要更多的特许学校。扎克伯格则想要提高教师的地位，并奖励能够改善学生表现的教学。

Booker's idea had some positive impact but the algorithm would assign kids to schools that required a walk through dangerous area in the city. Christie's idea might have had some good impact. It was the only idea aimed against the present system. It might increase freedoms for kids. However, the idea would not get far with present laws, and its impact would probably be negligible anyway. Zuckerberg's thinking is [Gatesian](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_is_wrong_about_education): strong on math and systems science, weak on feasibility and effect.

Booker 的想法带来了一些积极影响，但这种算法会把孩子分配到需要穿过城市危险区域的学校。Christie 的想法可能也产生了一些积极影响，因为它是唯一一个旨在对现有系统进行改革的想法。它可能会增加孩子的自由，但是这个想法在现有法律下可能无法实现，而且其影响可能微乎其微。扎克伯格的思路类似于[盖茨的思路](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_is_wrong_about_education)：强调数学和系统科学，但是在可行性和效果方面相对较弱。

How would I spend $100 million? I would rather use it to individually help kids who struggle for no fault of their own. The system can gobble any amount of money and the investment won't make much difference. How did Mark's money got spent? I hate to be an armchair critic, hindsight is 50/50, but I still claim the outcome was easy to predict:

我如何使用 1 亿美元？我宁愿用这笔钱来帮助那些不是自己过错却仍在挣扎的孩子。现有的系统可能会吞噬任何数量的资金，而这项投资并不会带来太大的改变。马克·扎克伯格的钱花在哪里了？我不想成为一个只会坐在椅子上批评的人，因为回头看事情总是很容易，但我仍然认为这个结果是可以预见的：

\> Their five-year plan gets off to a rocky start. Initial funds go to a bevy of consultants, most of them white, most of them well connected, some of whom are getting paid $1,000 a day. One educator labels them the “school failure industry”

\> 他们的五年计划起步并不顺利。最初的资金被用于聘请大量顾问，其中大部分是白人，大多有很强的关系网络，其中一些人每天拿着 1000 美元的酬劳。一位教育家将他们称为“学校失败产业”。 

The big problem with good hearts of Zuckerberg or [Gates](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_is_wrong_about_education) is that they are great at what they do, and this seeds them with a degree of hubris that whatever they touch will turn gold. Luckily, they both have learned their painful lessons by now:

尽管扎克伯格和[盖茨](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_is_wrong_about_education)都拥有善良的心灵，且在自己的领域内表现出色，但这也让他们对自己在其他领域的能力过于自信。这种自信导致了一定的盲目性，让他们认为无论参与什么领域都能取得成功。幸运的是，他们通过痛苦的经历吸取了教训：

\> Zuckerberg came to recognize that school reform alone isn’t enough, that if we’re going to make a difference in the classroom, we also need to make a difference in the lives of these children, many of whom struggle against the debilitating effects of poverty and trauma

\> 扎克伯格认识到，仅仅进行学校改革是不够的，如果我们想在课堂上产生影响，我们还需要改善这些孩子的生活，其中很多人面临贫困和创伤的困扰。
