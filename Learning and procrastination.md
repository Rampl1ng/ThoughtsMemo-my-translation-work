# Learning and procrastination

If learning is the most sustainable form of pleasure, why do half of the students procrastinate? This is nearly a triple of the figure for the general population.

如果学习是最可持续的获取快乐的形式，那么为什么大半数学生会拖延呢？这几乎是全球人口的三分之一。

The answer is simple and important: students procrastinate because as much as good learning is a pleasure, bad learning is highly unpleasant. Most of assignments at school or even college carry a great deal of mismatch with the needs of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive). This kind of learning is ineffective and unpleasant. Those kids will often play computer games in the evening claiming they *need to rest their brains*. I doubt their brains are at rest. They actually do jobs that they find pleasurable. A great deal of that pleasure comes from new learning. Unfortunately, there are no credits at school for good gaming, so the sinusoidal cycle of chores-and-fun begins on the next day or even the same day with homework.

答案很简单也很重要：学生拖延是因为好的学习是一种乐趣，而坏的学习是一种折磨。大多数学校甚至大学布置的作业都与[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)的需求相当不匹配。这样的学习实际上是低效且不快的。这些孩子经常在晚上玩电脑游戏，理由是他们**需要让大脑得到休息**。我怀疑他们的大脑在玩游戏时并没有得到休息。他们实际上是在做他们认为令人愉悦的工作。这种快乐很大程度上来自于学习新事物。不幸的是，游戏玩得好并不会在学校拿到更多的学分，因此无聊的学习和娱乐的正弦循环在第二天甚至是家庭作业的同一天便开始了。

I never stop being amazed how many students call themselves lazy. At the same time they can do many heroic feats of physical of mental work as long as these are enjoyable or serve their own goals. Even those with thousands of memorized items in SuperMemo often give themselves low conscientiousness scores. Goals of learning can be hazy, but even if they are crystal clear, poor match between the input and prior knowledge can result in significant displeasure. If [learntropy](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learntropy) is low, assignments can be boring. If it is negative, they will be repulsive.

一直以来，我对「那么多学生称自己懒惰」感到惊讶。实际上，他们可以在体力劳动或脑力劳动方面完成许多艰苦卓绝的壮举，只要它们是令人愉快的或为他们自己的目标服务的。即使是那些在 SuperMemo 中记住了数千条目的人，也经常给自己打出很低的责任心分数。学习的目标可能是模糊的，但即使它们是清晰明确的，输入和前置知识之间的不匹配也会导致严重的不快。如果[学习熵](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learntropy)较低，任务可能会很无聊。如果学习熵是负的，任务将会是令人厌恶的。

The battle between high goal valuations and negative rewards of bad learning will result in procrastination. Procrastinators often call themselves lazy even if they are nothing but.

高目标估值和不良学习的奖励负值之间的斗争将导致拖延。拖延者经常地自称懒惰，即使他们并不懒。

If you think you are lazy about learning, you need to re-evaluate your materials and your methodology. Even simple violations of the [natural creativity cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle) can kill the fun of learning.

如果你认为你是学习懒人，那么你需要重新评估手上的学习材料，以及学习方法论。即使是稍稍违反[自然创造力周期](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle)，学习的乐趣也会被扼杀。
