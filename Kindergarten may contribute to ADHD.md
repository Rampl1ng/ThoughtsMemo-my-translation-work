According to the study co-authored by Stanford Graduate School of Education Professor Thomas Dee, **children who started kindergarten a year later showed significantly lower levels of inattention and hyperactivity**, which are jointly considered a key indicator of self regulation. The beneficial result was found to persist even at age 11. *“We found that delaying kindergarten for one year reduced inattention and hyperactivity by 73 percent for an average child at age 11 and it **virtually eliminated** the probability that an average child at that age would have an ‘abnormal,’ or higher-than-normal rating for the inattentive-hyperactive behavioral measure*”

根据斯坦福大学教育研究生院教授 Thomas Dee 共同撰写的研究报告，“晚一年上幼儿园的儿童表现出明显较低水平的注意力不集中和多动性”。这两者通常被认为是自我调节的关键指标。这一有益的现象甚至会延续到 11 岁。我们发现，对于 11 岁的普通儿童来说，推迟一年上幼儿园，注意力不集中和多动的水平降低了 73%，并且**几乎完全消除了**该年龄段的普通儿童在「注意力不集中-多动行为测量」方面出现「异常」或「超出正常水平」的可能性。
